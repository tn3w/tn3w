## About Me

I am TN3W, a German hobby programmer proficient in Python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Beyond programming, I enjoy indulging in video games. My philosophical stance aligns with the belief that information should be freely accessible to all. Motivated by this conviction, I actively contribute to enhancing digital privacy. Presently, I operate both a Tor node and a bridge as part of my efforts in this realm. My passion extends to exploring technologies such as proxies, bridges, and the Tor network, as they play pivotal roles in safeguarding online privacy and anonymity.
